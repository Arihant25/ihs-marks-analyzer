# Intro to Human Sciences (IHS) Marks Analyzer

Are you tired of hearing about how different people got wildly different marks in IHS exams?

Well wonder no more! This program will analyze the marks of your classmates and provide you with a detailed breakdown of the results.

We just ask one thing - honestly report your marks. We will not share your data with anyone, and it will only be used to generate the results.

## How to Use

Go to [ihs-marks-analyzer.vercel.app](https://ihs-marks-analyzer.vercel.app) and fill in your marks. The program will then analyze the data and provide you with a detailed breakdown of the results.

## Tech Stack

This project is completely built with Next.js.
MongoDB is used to store the data, and the site is deployed on Vercel.
